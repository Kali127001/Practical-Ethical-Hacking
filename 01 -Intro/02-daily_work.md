# A Day in the Life of an Ethical Hacker

## Overview :
- Roll Out of Bed :smile:
- Perform an Assessment
- Write a Report
- Give a Debrief

## Assessments :
### External Network Pen Test :
<pre>
An external pen test is looking organization's security from the outside. This methodology is based on <strong>OSINT - Open-Source Intelligence</strong>. Gathering data or intel about an organization. Who are their employees, what is their email format? Have they ever been involved in a breach? Can we find out what passwords were in those breaches? Can we collect data and then use it against that organization to breach a login panel or breach the VPN or get into an area where we otherwise would not be allowed into?

This is the most common type of assessment pen testers do, reasons:
<li>A lot of organizations dictate that an external network pen test must be performed annually.</li><li>It's tend to be a little bit cheaper than other assessments.</li>
These pen tests tend to last around 32 to 40 hours, on an average though if you hae a very large engagement, that can go a lot longer. Minimum 8 to 16 hours for small organization. Another 8 to 16 hours for <strong>report writing</strong>.
</pre>

### Internal Network Pen Test :
<pre>
This is assessing an organization security from the inside of the network. This means we somehow breached the perimeter. Perhaps we sent an phishing email and somebody opened our email, clicked on our link, and now we're inside the network. Now, the methodology for internal penetration test focuses heavily on active directory. If you don't know what active directory attacks are, you absolutely need to learn those to be a <strong>Successful Internal Penetration Tester</strong>. And it's one of those things that majority of the organizations that are out there use. Of the Fortune 500 companies use active directory in their environments. Nearly 99% organizations use active directory environment.

These pen tests tend to last around 32 to 40 hours, on an average though if you hae a very large engagement, that can go a lot longer. Minimum 16 to 24 hours for very small organization not less than this. Another 8 to 16 hours for <strong>report writing</strong>.
</pre>

### Web Application Pen Test :
<pre>
There are websites everywhere. The methodology focuses heavily on web-based attacks, and <strong>OWASP - Open Worldwide Application Security Project</strong> testing guidelines.

These pen tests tend to last around 32 to 40 hours, and that is pretty much the minimum, that can go a lot longer. Another 8 to 16 hours for <strong>report writing</strong>.
</pre>


### Wireless Pen Test :
<pre>
Accessing an organization's wireless network security. Methodology depends on wireless type being used (guest vs WPA2-PSK vs WPA2 Enterprise)

These typically lasts 4 to 8 hours per SSID with another 2  to 4 hours for <strong>report writing</strong>.
</pre>

### Physical Pen Test & Social Engineering :
<pre>
For Physical Pen testing we're going on site and trying to break into the building. That can be through cloning badges, that can be through social engineering, that can be through picking locks. The methodology depends on what we're up against, and it also depends on the client goal. Other side there is a pure Social Engineering, doing something like a fishing campaign against an organization, and we might actually do a fishing campaign in with an external pen test. So we might combine those together, though often they're left apart. Sometimes we do vishing campaign where we call people and we say, Hey, I'm from IT, can you give me the code I just sent you to your account. Same with smishing campaign.

Typically lasts 16 to 40 hours maybe even more depending on the engagement you're on. Plus another 4 to 8  hours for <strong>report writing</strong>.
</pre>

## Other Assessments :
- Mobile Penetration Testing (iOS or Android)
- IoT Penetration Testing
- Red Team Engagements (Offensive Team)
- Purple Team Engagements (Red Team & Blue Team combined)
- Plus more  (Car Hacking, Airplane Hacking, SCADA Hacking)

## Report Writing
- A report is typically delivered within a week after the engagement ends.
- Report should highlight both non-technical(executive) and technical findings.
- Recommendations for remediation should be clear to both executives and technical staff.

## Debrief
- A debrief walks through your report findings. This can be with technical and non-technical staff present.
- It gives an opportunity for the client to ask questions and address any concerns before a final report is released
